when you are building an app 

the first thing to do is to plan 
plan the UI 



inline styles takes a javascript object 

styles={{backgroundColor:red}}

or 

styling={
    color:red,
}

styles={styling}

big application uses "config driven ui"

when the UI is driven by data . ie controlling your ui using data/config from the backend 

ui layer 
data layer 
be good at both 

cloudinary is a CDN for hosting images 

Best practices 
1.Use optional changing 
2.Always map and give a map key

always use unique keys 
or use index as a last rsort not recommended
